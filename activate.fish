# venv-style activation of the Phi dev environment for fish.
#
#   source ./activate.fish
#
# The fish counterpart of ./activate: applies the composed pm env to the
# CURRENT shell, with save/restore (`deactivate` undoes exactly what activation
# changed), makes `phi` a function for this checkout, and prefixes the prompt
# with the worktree name. Scripts and other processes run under
# `scripts/run-in-phi-env` instead.
#
# Options: `--test-extras a,b` selects the test environment's runtime extras
# (default: [all]).
#
# Composition (setup sync, bootstrap Python, pm env) is shared with ./activate
# through scripts/_activation.sh, so this file only applies its output.
