"""Who may write a gateway service definition (systemd unit, launchd plist).

A service definition pins the ``PHI_HOME`` its gateway runs with. Service names are derived from the
home (bare / profile name / path hash), and two homes can still resolve to the same name: a custom root's
``<root>/profiles/<name>`` takes the same ``phi-gateway-<name>`` unit as ``~/.phi/profiles/<name>``.
Every gateway boot refreshes "its" unit, so a scratch or E2E gateway started from such a home rewrote the
real install's unit to point at the scratch directory, and the real gateway failed on its next restart.

The rule: a definition that pins a home is written only by a process acting for that home. Uninstall
already refused a unit pinning another home (``_systemd_unit_belongs_to_current_home``); the writers now
refuse the same way. ``phi gateway install --force-unit-path`` is the explicit repoint.
